    # Resource limits (OPTIONAL - commented out by default)
    #
    # By default, Docker containers can use ALL host RAM without limits.
    # The startup script auto-detects available RAM from the host/container.
    #
    # Use cases for setting memory limits:
    # 1. Multi-tenant hosts - prevent one container from starving others
    # 2. Shared hosting - enforce resource quotas per customer
    # 3. Testing - simulate lower-memory environments
    #
    # NOTE: If you set a limit, the auto-detection will see ONLY that limit,
    # not the host's total RAM. For example, with "memory: 8G", the script
    # detects 8G and allocates ~6G heap (leaving 2G overhead).
    #
    # deploy:
    #   resources:
    #     limits:
    #       memory: 8G  # Maximum RAM container can use
    #     reservations:
    #       memory: 6G  # Minimum RAM to guarantee
